\chapter[Modeling, Designing and Simulation of Grow Box]{Modeling, Designing and Simulation of Grow Box}
\section*{Abstract}
Grow Box is partially or completely closed system to grow plants.To grow plants in closed box, environment needs to be provided. The existing Grow Box has all the necessary properties and has potential to be a product. It is now time to put everything in order, in terms of hardware, a good water container, flexibility and its structure. By doing this not only it will make market appealing, but also brings in an design attitude towards project development cycle. This report contains process to design the Grow Box outer structure along with flow simulation of air inside the system. It also contains the step by step process to assemble the Grow Box.

\subsection*{Completion status}
Two version of Grow Box has been designed. Fabrication of version1 is not feasible due to its complex design. Version2 has been fabricated with all the Electronics hardware. \begin{figure}[h!]\begin{center}

  \caption{Current Working Model}
\end{center}\end{figure}

\section{Modeling and Designing}
While designing the Grow Box following points have been considered
\begin{itemize}
\item Air Circulation
\item Temperature Control
\item Light Positioning
\item Size
\item Modularity
\item Cost
\item DIY Design
\item Aesthetics
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Grow Box V0}
This is first prototype to be fabricated for testing purpose. This model consists of L shaped aluminum extrusion as framing structure, joined with fasteners. \\

\end{figure}
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuCj2OUl2X8}{Air Flow Simulation in Grow Box Version0} in Solid Works.\\
This design consists of one inlet fan and one exhaust fan situated on the side wall of Grow Box. inlet fan is at lower position than exhaust fan. The flow of air is not proper as air comes from inlet and directly hit the other side of wall.

\subsection{Grow Box V1}
This is the \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGrjrwHcsWk}{first version} and is designed in Autodesk Fusion 360. This design consists of aluminum tube and 3 way, 4 Way, 5Way connectors as framing structure. It has provision of light positioning and water storage. This model has more space for electronics hardware positioning. The  door is attached to the model with the help of magnets. There is also provision of water storage at the bottom.   \\

\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_HcFKEwkE}{Air Flow Simulation in Grow Box Version1} in Solid Works. This model consists of two inlet points, situated at the side walls and two exhaust point, situated at the top panel. To allow proper distribution of inlet air, duct is provided. This allow air to come from all directions. There is also perforated pseudo top panel to allow air to exit from  everywhere, instead of one point exit.
\begin{figure}[h!]

\caption{Air Flow Simulation in V1}
\end{figure}
\\Advantages of version1 are as follows:-
\begin{itemize}
    \item Good air flow inside the Grow Box.
    \item This design is modular. So, it can be stacked vertically or horizontally by just changing the Aluminum Tube with MS Tubes.
    \item Water storage facility is present.
    \item Light position can be changed as required
    \item DIY Design.
\end{itemize}
The disadvantage of this model are as follows- 
\begin{itemize}
\item The cost of fabrication of this model is high due to complex design. 
\item This design is bigger in size compared to existing model.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Grow Box V2}
This is the \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTjnuqw7IV8}{Second version} and is designed in Autodesk Fusion 360. This model has been fabricated. Framing structure of this model is done using aluminum tube and 3 way connectors. The supporting structure is 6mm thick acrylic sheets. Transparent acrylic is provided from all four side to provide aesthetic look. Top and bottom portion have opaque acrylic to hide the electronic  components.\\
\begin{figure}[h!]

To see the 3D Model  \href{http://a360.co/2sLIiCD}{Click}\\
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_HcFKEwkE}{Air Flow Simulation in Grow Box Version2} in Solid Works. In this only inlet fans are provided. Fans are located at horizontal plane. Curved panel is used to change the direction of air. Outlet openings are provided in side walls and top walls.
In this the air comes from inlet point and strikes the curved panel and then flows toward the plant and LED lights. Thus, allowing air to flow over plants as well as cool the LED flood lights and then exit through outlet points. \\
\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=200pt]{version_2_FV}

\caption{Air Flow Simulation in V2}
\end{figure}
\\Reasons why this model has been fabricated-
\begin{itemize}
    \item Good air flow inside the Grow Box.
    \item Less cost compared to version1 design.
    \item DIY design, as design is not complex, so anyone can assemble it with ease.
    \item This design is modular. So, it can be stacked vertically or horizontally by just changing the Aluminum Tube with MS Tubes.
    \item This design is smaller in size compared to existing and version1 model.
\end{itemize}
The disadvantage of this model are- 
\begin{itemize}
\item There is no provision of water storage. So water level have to be checked regularly. 
\item This design have no provision for exhaust fans. In this design number of inlet fans have been increased to compensate for exhaust fans.
\end{itemize}

\section{Hardware parts}
\subsection{List of hardware}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Square Aluminum Pipe
  \item Square Connectors
  \item Clear Acrylic Sheets
  \item Opaque Acrylic Sheets
  \item Fasteners
  \item Magnets
  \item Aluminum or Mild Steel Strips
  \item Axial Flow Fans
  \item Sunboard or Foam Board
  \item Brackets
  \end{enumerate}
  \subsection{Detail of each hardware:}
  Different parts of Grow Box are as follows:
   \begin{enumerate}
  \item Square Aluminum Pipe  \href{https://www.justdial.com/Mumbai/Variety-Aluminium-Ghatkopar-West/022P1932129_BZDET}{Vendor link},\\
  Aluminum Square tubing is used as supporting structure because of its light weight, relative strength, superior resistance to corrosion and easy to work with properties.\\
  When vertical stacking is needed these Aluminum tubing can be replaced by High strength steel pipes due to more relative strength.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \href{http://a360.co/2sqg5SJ}{Tube 93.2}\\
  \begin{figure}[h!]\begin{center}

\end{center}\end{figure}
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Clear Acrylic Sheets\\
  These provide clear view of the plants inside. These are mainly provided for aesthetic look. These also acts as supporting structures.\\
  Front mid panel is attached to the framing structure using magnets. This can be removed when needed.

  \end{enumerate}
   \end{enumerate}
  \item Fasteners\\
  Fasteners are used to attach acrylic sheets to aluminum tubes together. 
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Screw\\
  Diameter of the screw used here is 1/8 inches.
  \item Screw Bolts\\
  Its size depend on fans being used.
  \item Screw Nuts
  
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Magnets\href{http://www.amazon.in/Perfect-Magnets-Nickel-Coated-Pieces/dp/B01LY18VN3/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1499193943&sr=8-7&keywords=magnets}{ Vendor link},\\
  These are used to hold the front mid panel. Using these removes latches to hold the panel, thus removing any protrusions. 
  \item Mild Steel/Aluminum Strips\\
  These are used to hold the LED Flood Lights.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \href{http://a360.co/2sGs5DH}{Light Holders}
   \end{enumerate}
  \item Sun Board or Foam Board\\
   Sunboard acts as sealing agent by not allowing the air inside to leak from sides
  \begin{figure}[h!] \begin{center}

  \caption{Sun Board Sealing Agent}
  \end{center}\end{figure}

  \item Axial Flow Fans\href{http://www.amazon.in/60x60x25mm-Brushless-12V-Cooling-Fan/dp/B01MS9AHPC/ref=sr_1_99?ie=UTF8&qid=1499194646&sr=8-99&keywords=dc+fans+12v}{ Vendor link},\\
  An axial fan is a type of a compressor that increases the pressure of the air flowing through it. The blades of the axial flow fans force air to move parallel to the shaft about which the blades rotate.\\
