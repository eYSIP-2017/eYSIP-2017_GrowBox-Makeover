\chapter[Project Tag]{Modeling, Designing and Simulation of Grow Box}
\section*{Abstract}
Grow Box is partially or completely closed system to grow plants.So, in order to grow plant, environment needs to be provided. The existing Grow Box has all the necessary properties and has potential to be a product. It's now time to put everything in order, in terms of hardware, a good water container, flexibility and its structure. By doing this not only it will make market appealing, but also brings in an design attitude towards project development cycle. This report contains process to design the Grow Box Hardware along with flow simulation of air inside the system. It also contains the step by step process to assemble the Grow Box.

\subsection*{Completion status}
Two version of Grow Box has been designed. Version2 has been fabricated with all the Electronics hardware.

\section{Modeling and Designing}
Design consideration
\begin{itemize}
\item Air Circulation
\item Temperature Control
\item Light Positioning
\item Size
\item Modularity
\item Cost
\item DIY Design
\item Aesthetics
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Grow Box V0}
This is first prototype to be fabricated.\\

\includegraphics[width=200pt]{version_0_FV}
\includegraphics[width=200pt]{version_0_ISO}

\subsection{Grow Box V1}
This is the \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGrjrwHcsWk}{first version} and is designed in Autodesk Fusion 360.\\

\includegraphics[width=200pt]{version_1_FV}
\includegraphics[width=200pt]{version_1_ISO}\\
Advantages of version1 are as follows:-
\begin{itemize}
    \item Good air flow inside the Grow Box.
    \item This design is modular. So, it can be stacked vertically or horizontally by just changing the Aluminum Tube with MS Tubes.
    \item Water storage facility is present.
    \item Light position can be changed as required
    \item DIY Design.
\end{itemize}
The disadvantage of this model are as follows- 
\begin{itemize}
\item The cost of fabrication of this model is high due to complex design. 
\item This design is bigger in size compared to existing model.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Grow Box V2}
This is the \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTjnuqw7IV8}{Second version} and is designed in Autodesk Fusion 360. This model has been fabricated.\\

\includegraphics[width=200pt]{version_2_FV}
\includegraphics[width=200pt]{version_2_ISO}
Reasons why this model has been fabricated-
\begin{itemize}
    \item Good air flow inside the Grow Box.
    \item Less cost compared to version1 design.
    \item DIY design, as design is not complex, so anyone can assemble it with ease.
    \item This design is modular. So, it can be stacked vertically or horizontally by just changing the Aluminum Tube with MS Tubes.
    \item This design is smaller in size compared to existing and version1 model.
\end{itemize}
The disadvantage of this model are- 
\begin{itemize}
\item There is no provision of water storage. So water level have to be checked regularly. 
\item This design have no provision for exhaust fans. In this design number of inlet fans have been increased to compensate for exhaust fans.
\end{itemize}

\section{Hardware parts}
\begin{itemize}
  \item List of hardware
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Square Aluminum Pipe
  \item Square Connectors
  \item Clear Acrylic Sheets
  \item Opaque Acrylic Sheets
  \item Fasteners
  \item Magnets
  \item Aluminum or Mild Steel Strips
  \item Axial Flow Fans
  \item SunBoard or Foam Board
  \item Brackets
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Detail of each hardware:\\\\
  Different parts of Grow Box are as follows:
   \begin{enumerate}
  \item Square Aluminum Pipe  \href{https://www.justdial.com/Mumbai/Variety-Aluminium-Ghatkopar-West/022P1932129_BZDET}{Vendor link},\\
  Aluminum Square tubing is used as supporting structure because of its light weight, relative strength, superior resistance to corrosion and easy to work with properties.\\
  When vertical stacking is needed these Aluminum tubing can be replaced by High strength steel pipes due to more relative strength.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \href{http://a360.co/2sqg5SJ}{Tube 93.2}
  \item \href{http://a360.co/2tpFQUh}{Tube 43}   
  \item \href{http://a360.co/2tpFQUh}{Tube 65}   
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Square Connectors\href{https://www.indiamart.com/digitalmetrology/tube-connector.html}{Vendor link},\\
  No fasteners are required to fix them, friction holds the framing together. This makes it easy to use and anyone can join these like Lego blocks.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \href{http://a360.co/2sMp2oQ}{3 Way 90deg Elbow Square Connectors} 
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Clear Acrylic Sheets\\
  These provide clear view of the plants inside. These are mainly provided for aesthetic look. These also acts as supporting structures.\\
  Front mid panel is attached to the framing structure using magnets. This can be removed when needed.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \href{http://a360.co/2sq8qUr}{Front Mid Panel}
  \item \href{http://a360.co/2sGPxAG}{Rear Mid Panel}   
  \item \href{http://a360.co/2thgj1m}{Right Side Mid Panel} 
  \item \href{http://a360.co/2thgj1m}{Left Side Mid Panel}
   \item \href{http://a360.co/2tJ37U7}{Side Curve Panel}
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Opaque Acrylic Sheets\\
  These are used to hold the outer aluminum structure together and thus acting as supporting structures.These are attached to the aluminum tubes using screws. These are opaque to hide the turf, electronics and lights.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \href{http://a360.co/2sGEDLo}{Front Top Panel}
  \item \href{http://a360.co/2sqkqoI}{Front Bottom Panel}
  \item \href{http://a360.co/2th6yjx}{Rear Top Panel} 
  \item \href{http://a360.co/2thjbLA}{Rear Bottom Panel}
  \item \href{http://a360.co/2sGqayR}{Right Side Top Panel}  
  \item \href{http://a360.co/2sGInMZ}{Right Side Bottom Panel}
  \item \href{http://a360.co/2sGqayR}{Left Side Top Panel}
  \item \href{http://a360.co/2sGInMZ}{Left Side Bottom Panel}
  \item \href{http://a360.co/2tJ6avt}{Top Panel}
  \item \href{http://a360.co/2tIuY6K}{Base Panel}
  \item \href Component Box Panels
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \href{http://a360.co/2sGOZLh}{Top Panel}
  \item \href{http://a360.co/2tpwkkd}{Side Panel}
  \item \href{http://a360.co/2sMPwGt}{Rear Panel}
  \item \href{http://a360.co/2sGHmog}{Partition Panel}
  \end{enumerate}
   \end{enumerate}
  \item Fasteners\\
  Fasteners are used to attach acrylic sheets to aluminum tubes together. 
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Screw\\
  Diameter of the screw used here is 1/8 inches.
  \item Screw Bolts
  \item Screw Nuts
  \item Butterfly Nut
  \item Bolt
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Magnets\href{http://www.amazon.in/Perfect-Magnets-Nickel-Coated-Pieces/dp/B01LY18VN3/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1499193943&sr=8-7&keywords=magnets}{ Vendor link},\\
  These are used to hold the front mid panel. Using these removes latches to hold the panel, thus removing any protrusions. 
  \item Mild Steel/Aluminum Strips\\
  These are used to hold the LED Flood Lights.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \href{http://a360.co/2sGs5DH}{Light Holders}
   \end{enumerate}
  \item Sun Board or Foam Board\\
   Sunboard acts as sealing agent by not allowing the air inside to leak from sides
  \item Brackets
  \item Axial Flow Fans\href{http://www.amazon.in/60x60x25mm-Brushless-12V-Cooling-Fan/dp/B01MS9AHPC/ref=sr_1_99?ie=UTF8&qid=1499194646&sr=8-99&keywords=dc+fans+12v}{ Vendor link},\\
  An axial fan is a type of a compressor that increases the pressure of the air flowing through it. The blades of the axial flow fans force air to move parallel to the shaft about which the blades rotate.\\
  \includegraphics[width=200pt]{Fan60x60x25}\\
  Product specification voltage: 12v current: 0. 12 - 0. 21 a dimensions: 60 x 60 x 25 mm (lxwxh) DC brushless motor fan brand can be different as shown in picture but other features and dimensions will remain same.

\section{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
\item Top panel needs to be redesigned in order to allow cooling of LED Flood Light.
\item To control temperature, Heater and chiller unit need to be added.
\item To control humidity, Humidifier need to be added.
